# ReefQuest

*The “Eat the Frog” productivity concept suggests tackling your hardest task first each day. ReefQuest is inspired by this idea and gamifies it so that tasks feel like game challenges. Research shows that framing real-life tasks as games makes them more engaging and rewarding. Each morning the app draws one “important” task and one “self-care” task at random, turning your to-dos into a fun daily quest and reinforcing the habit of rewarding yourself.*

## Features

* **Task Lists:** Keep two lists of tasks – “Important Tasks” you must do and “Self-Care Tasks” for personal well-being.
* **Daily Challenges:** Every day, the app randomly selects one task from each list for you to complete.
* **Points & Rewards:** Completing tasks earns points. The points you accumulate each month become a personal reward fund, encouraging you to consciously treat yourself (reinforcing healthy reward habits).
* **Rerolls:** You have 3 *rerolls* per week in each category to shuffle unappealing tasks and stay motivated.
* **Combo Multipliers:** Whenever you complete a task, you can immediately request another. This forms a “combo” streak that increases the points multiplier for consecutive successes.
* **Gamified Motivation:** By treating real tasks as game objectives, ReefQuest aims to boost motivation and enjoyment. Completing tasks triggers satisfying feedback and rewards, making daily chores feel more like play.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) on your machine and set up an emulator or connect a device.
2. **Clone the Repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sharkspi/ReefQuest.git

   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run the App:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   This will build and launch ReefQuest on your chosen platform.

ReefQuest is built with Flutter (Dart) and targets multiple platforms. The project folder includes directories for **android**, **ios**, **web**, **linux**, **macos**, and **windows**. Native code is used where appropriate (e.g. Swift for iOS/macOS, C++ for desktop) to ensure a smooth cross-platform experience.

## Tech Stack

* **Flutter & Dart:** Core framework and language for UI and logic.
* **Platform Support:** Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux builds.
* **Other Languages:** Platform-specific code in Swift (iOS/macOS), C++ (Windows/Linux), and HTML/C (Web) as needed.

## About

ReefQuest was created by *Sharkspi* to demonstrate how productivity techniques and gamification can work together. It applies the “Eat the Frog” method by encouraging one key task per day, and uses game-like points and rewards to make task completion more engaging. By assigning points to a personal reward fund, it also promotes the habit of celebrating your achievements and self-care.

Visit the [ReefQuest GitHub repo](https://github.com/Sharkspi/ReefQuest) to view the source code and track progress.

**References:** Research on the “Eat the Frog” productivity technique, gamification in task management, and gamified self-care rewards has informed the design of this app.
